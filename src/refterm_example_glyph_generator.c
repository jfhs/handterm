       Regardless of whether DirectWrite or GDI is used, rasterizing glyphs via Windows' libraries is extremely slow.

       It may appear that this code path itself is the reason for the slowness, because this does a very inefficient
       "draw-then-transfer" for every glyph group, which is the slowest possible way you could do it.  However, I
       actually _tried_ doing batching, where you make a single call to DirectWrite or GDI to rasterize
       large sets of glyphs which are then transfered all at once.

       Although this does help the performance (IIRC there was about 2x total speedup in heavy use),
       the peformance is still about two orders of magnitude away from where it should be.  So I removed the batching,
       because it complicates the code quite a bit, and does not actually produce acceptable performance.

       I believe the only solution to actual fast glyph generation is to just write something that isn't as
       bad as GDI/DirectWrite.  It's a waste of code complexity to try to get a reasonable speed out of them, unless
       someone else manages to find some magic switches I didn't find that make them work at a high speed in
       bulk.
